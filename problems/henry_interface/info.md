This directory was made to test the implementation of the HenryDiffusionInterface
(InterfaceKernel). 

# Test 1: 
One way henry diffusion (only gas to liquid, for example)

# Test 2: 
Two way henry diffusion - diffusion can go in or out of an interface, depending
on the henry coefficient (e.g. whether the interface material is saturated).

The Henry diffusion interface is based on work done by
